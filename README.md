## Service Worker

### Development

While actively developing, the Service Worker, you will want to change some settings in your browser.

In **Chrome**, open your Console and go to the Application > Service Workers section. Check the 'Update on reload' box so that the service worker is refreshed on each page reload. This will allow you to see and test your changes as you develop.
